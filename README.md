## ExpLog_Tracker
An expense log data entry program I am creating. You simply input product, price, category you wish to put the product under, and a short description (optional). It then saves all this information into a .csv file.

Categories are saved within the categ.npy file for easy editingâ€“categories can now be added or deleted based on its position within the .npy file, meaning category changes will be universal within the log.csv file.
